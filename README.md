# NVIM configuration

Here's a repo for my nvim configuration. Nvim has been chosen so that it could help increase the speed and skills of coding. 

I use packer to organize my extensions.

Here's a list of the different extensions i use: 

* telescope
* tokyonight (colorscheme)
* lsp-zero
* treesitter
* harpoon
* undotree
* vim-fugitive
